/**
 * This class is where the bulk of the robot should be declared. Since Command-based is a
 * "declarative" paradigm, very little robot logic should actually be handled in the [Robot]
 * periodic methods (other than the scheduler calls). Instead, the structure of the robot (including
 * subsystems, commands, and trigger mappings) should be declared here.
 *
 * In Kotlin, it is recommended that all your Subsystems are Kotlin objects. As such, there
 * can only ever be a single instance. This eliminates the need to create reference variables
 * to the various subsystems in this container to pass into to commands. The commands can just
 * directly reference the (single instance of the) object.
